            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF Sir Caeſar Wood, alias Cranmer, Kt. Appellant, AGAINST CHARLES Duke of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Reſpondent, from a Decree of the late Lord <hi>Jefferies</hi> in <hi>Chancery,</hi> between the ſaid CHARLES Duke of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Complainant, and the ſaid Appellant, Defendant.</head>
            <head type="sub">Humbly Preſented to the Conſideration of the Right Honorable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Aſſembled.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>Henry Wood</hi> being Owner of a Real Eſtate of about 3500 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and a Perſonal Eſtate of good value, having Iſſue <hi>Mary Wood,</hi> his only Child, <hi>Anno</hi> 1671. An Overture was made to him by direction of his late Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> II. for the Marriage of his ſaid Daughter to the now Reſpondent, then Earl of <hi>Southampton:</hi> And it was offered by His Majeſty, in behalf of the now Reſpondent, to ſettle 2000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> on the Reſpondent, and the ſaid <hi>Mary,</hi> for her Joynture, with Remainder to the Iſſue of the Marriage; Provided the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> would ſettle his Real Eſtate aforeſaid, from and after his own death, upon the Reſpondent and the ſaid <hi>Mary,</hi> and their Iſſue. Which Propoſals Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> approved, as to the Settlement to be made on either ſide. But his Daughter being then but ſeven years of Age, and the Reſpondent but eleven years old; Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> would not conſent that the Marriage ſhould be had till after his Daughter ſhould have attained her Age of ſixteen years, and then to be at her Election, whether ſhe ſhould Marry the Reſpondent or not. And thoſe that Treated for the Reſpondent, inſiſting it might be to his diſadvantage, if <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould refuſe to Marry him after her Age of ſixteen years, (in regard he muſt forgo all opportunities of his Preferment, in Marriage, in the mean time,) Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> thereupon, and rather than he would conſent to his Daughters Marriage before her Age of ſixteen years, agreed that his Eſtate ſhould ſtand charged with 20000 <hi>l.</hi> for the benefit of the Reſpondent, as a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to him, in caſe <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould refuſe to Marry him after her Age of ſixteen years.</p>
            <p>And thereupon it was agreed, that the intended Marriage ſhould not be had until after the ſaid <hi>Maries</hi> Age of ſixteen years; and then to be at her Election to Marry the Earl or not, with a penalty of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> to be forfeited to the Reſpondent, in caſe ſhe then refuſed to Marry him.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> having made this Agreement on the 23. of <hi>May</hi> 1671. being but two days before his death, made a Settlement of his Eſtate accordingly, which he did in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the ſaid 2000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> would have been ſettled according to the ſaid Agreement; and the ſame is mentioned to be in conſideration of the ſettling of the ſaid 2000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> according to His Majeſties offer. And by this Settlement his whole Real Eſtate, of the value of 3500 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> was conveyed to Truſtees, upon Truſt that they ſhould receive the profits thereof till his Daughters Age of ſeventeen, or Marriage. And if after her Age of ſixteen, and before ſeventeen, ſhe ſhould refuſe to Marry the Reſpondent, then to pay the Reſpondent the ſaid 20000 <hi>l.</hi> as a Recompence. But if the Marriage ſhould take effect after her Age of ſixteen, and they ſhould have Iſſue Male, then the Truſtees to ſtand ſeized in Truſt for the Reſpondent, and the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> for their lives, with remainder to their Iſſue, in ſuch manner as is therein limited.</p>
            <p>But if the Marriage ſhould not take effect after her Age of ſixteen years, or in default of Iſſue of the Marriage; Then the Truſtees were to ſtand ſeized to ſuch uſes as the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> ſhould declare by his laſt Will.</p>
            <p>And at the ſame time Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> made his Will, (bearing date the day after the Settlement) whereby he recites and confirms the Settlement. And in caſe the Marriage ſhould not take effect according to the purport of the Settlement; Then he Deviſed his ſaid Real Eſtate to his ſaid Daughter for her life, with Remainder to her Iſſue by ſuch other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as ſhe ſhould Marry. And for default of ſuch Iſſue, he Intails the ſame on ſeveral of his own Relations, and particularly on the now Appellant, being his Nephew, for life, with Remainder to <hi>Henry</hi> his eldeſt Son in Tail Male, and to <hi>Charles</hi> his ſecond Son in Tall Male, (the Appellant and his Son, and their Iſſue, taking on them the name of <hi>Wood,</hi>) with other Remainders over.</p>
            <p>And he Deviſed the Rents and Profits of his Real Eſtate above what is appointed for his Daughters maintainance, (which was to be 450 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> till her Age of twelve years, afterwards 550 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> till her Age of ſeventeen,) and alſo all his Leaſes, and Perſonal Eſtate, to be laid out by his Truſtees, and his Executors therein named, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes of Lands, which he Willed ſhould be ſettled to the ſame uſes as his Real Eſtate was to go. And Deviſed the Tuition, and Guardianſhip of his Daughter, and her diſpoſal in Marriage, (with ſuch conſent as in his Will) to the Lady <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the Appellants Mother. And if ſhe dyed, then to ſeveral other perſons by name, of his own Relations ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſlively. And appointed the Lady <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wood</hi> his Brother, his Executors in Truſt for his Daughter, until ſuch her Marriage, or Age of twenty one years, and then his Daughter to be Executrix. And the next day after making his Will Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> dyed, his ſaid Daughter being then only of the Age of ſeven years.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Cheſter</hi> proved the Will, and took upon her the Guardianſhip, and Tuition of the ſaid <hi>Mary Wood,</hi> intending to have continued the ſame until her Age of ſixteen years, that ſo <hi>Mary</hi> might have had her free Election to Marry the Reſpondent or not, according to her Fathers intention expreſſed in his Settlement and Will: But within a few weeks after Sir <hi>Henry Woods</hi> death, ſhe was taken from the Lady <hi>Cheſter</hi> her Guardian, againſt her conſent, by, or by the procurement of, ſome perſons nearly related to the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And though the Lady <hi>Cheſter</hi> made great application for the Reſtoring of her, yet the perſons that detained her, being too great for her to contend withal, ſhe could not prevail to have her reſtored.

               </note> But on the contrary, about ſeven weeks after Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi>'s death, ſhe was privately Married to the Reſpondent, though ſhe was then but about ſeven years old, and the Reſpondent but about eleven years of Age, and this without the Conſent or privity of her Guardian, the Lady <hi>Cheſter,</hi> or any of the Truſtees appointed by her Fathers Will, or the Joynture of 2000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> ſettled. And the better to colour this extraordinary proceeding, a Nuncupative Codicil was ſet up, and endeavoured to to be proved in the Prerogative Court, whereby it was pretended Sir <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> contrary to his Will in writing, (which was made but the Evening before his death) had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed the Guardianſhip of his Daughter to her Grace the Ducheſs of <hi>Cleveland.</hi> But this project was ſpoiled by the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales,</hi> who upon examination of the Matter, Prohibited the proving of the Codicil.</p>
            <p>However,
<note place="margin">By his Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sir <hi>John Trevor,</hi> late Maſter of the Rolls, as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator, during the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of the Reſpondent.</note> the Reſpondent, upon this Marriage (ſuch as it was) Exhibited his Bill in the High Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> againſt the Executors of Sir <hi>Henry Woods</hi> Will, ſuggeſting that by this his Marriage, their Executorſhip was determined, and that his Wiſe was become Executrix, and the Reſpondent, in her Right, thereby intituled to the Perſonal Eſtate, and the Rents and Proſits of the Real Eſtate, and upon this account oppoſed the laying out of the ſame in Purchaſes of Lands, as Sir <hi>Henry Woods</hi> Settlement and Will had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. And <hi>Mary</hi> (being ſtill detained from her Guardian) at her Age of twelve years, was again Married to the Reſpondent, but without the conſent, or ſo much as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or privity of her Guardian, or any of her Truſtees, and the 2000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> not yet ſettled. And upon this ſecond Marriage, a new Bill was Exhibited againſt the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors and this Appellant, to the ſame effect with the former, but nothing was done thereupon.</p>
            <p>And on <hi>November</hi> 15. 1680. before any Settlement of the 2000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and before any Marriage, after her Age of ſixteen years, <hi>Mary</hi> dyed, and without Iſſue, by reaſon whereof all the uſes in the Settlement and Will, that were to ariſe on the Marriage with the Reſpondent became null and void. And the Rents and Profits of the Real Eſtate, above what was appointed for maintainance, and alſo the Perſonal Eſtate ought to have been laid out in Purchaſes of Lands, to be ſettled according to Sir <hi>Henry Woods</hi> Will, whereby the ſame would have come to the Appellant and his Sons, (in Remainder after the death of the Biſhop) according to the expreſs direction of the Will. And in the life time time of <hi>Mary,</hi> about 2000 <hi>l.</hi> thereof was accordingly laid out in a Purchaſe of Lands.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, The now Reſpondent having taken out Adminiſtration to <hi>Mary,</hi> and alſo Letters of Adminiſtration to Sir <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> with his Will annext (though nothing of Kin to him) in the year 1683. Exhibited a new Bill againſt the Executors of Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi>'s Will. And the Lady <hi>Cheſter</hi> (one of the Executors) dying, he revived the ſame againſt the Appellant, as Executor to the Lady <hi>Cheſter.</hi> And the effect of this Bill was to have the Perſonal Eſtate of Sir <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> and the Rents and Profits of the Real Eſtate to the time of <hi>Maries</hi> death, accounted for, and delivered to him the Reſpondent. And on hearing the Cauſe on the 27. day of <hi>October</hi> 1685. before the late Lord Chancellor <hi>Jefferies,</hi> his Lordſhip was pleaſed to declare, That it plainly appeared to be the intention of Sir <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> that the ſaid Marriage ſhould take effect before <hi>Maries</hi> Age of ſixteen years (though both the Settlement and Will appoints it to be between ſixteen and ſeventeen) And that by the Reſpondents Marriage (which was in ſuch manner as aforeſaid, and not otherwiſe,) the Executorſhip of the Lady <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and the Biſhop determined. And that by the Marriage (though no Settlement was made of the 2000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> on the Reſpondents part, or any Settlement at all on his part,) the Reſpondent was become Intituled to, and ought to have an account of the whole Perſonal Eſtate that Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi> left at his death, and the Rents and Profits of the Real Eſtate to the time of <hi>Maries</hi> death, and did Decree the ſame accordingly.</p>
            <p>So that by this Decree, the whole Perſonal Eſtate of Sir <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> and alſo all the Rents and Profits of his Real Eſtate, from the time of his death, to the time of the death of <hi>Mary,</hi> (which is about nine years) is to go to the Reſpondent: Whereas by the Will of Sir <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> the ſame ought to be laid out in Purchaſes of Lands, to be ſettled according to Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi>'s Will, Whereby the ſame would come to the Appellant, and his Sons, as aforeſaid. And in the Proſecution of this Decree, the Appellant, and other Defendants, are not only charged for the Perſonal Eſtate, and Profits that was remaining at <hi>Maries</hi> death, but alſo with the 2000 <hi>l.</hi> that was laid out in Lands, as if the ſame had yet continued Perſonal Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Now the Appellant humbly conceives,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>(Viz.)</hi> By taking away of <hi>Mary,</hi> and Marrying of her under Age contrary to her Fathers Will and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and is adviſed that this Decree is Erroneous. Firſt, Becauſe the Decree is founded on a falſe Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi>'s intention, that the Marriage with the Reſpondent ſhould take effect before <hi>Maries</hi> Age of ſixteen Whereas both by the Settlement and Will, it is appointed to be between ſixteen and ſeventeen. Secondly, Becauſe the Eſtate in queſtion is Decreed to the Reſpondent, contrary the Settlement and Will of Sir <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> and that notwithſtanding the 2000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> (which was the conſideration of Sir <hi>Henry Wood</hi>'s Settlement) was never ſettled, which is a ſtrange ſort of Equity. Thirdly, If this Decree ſhould ſtand, the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will profit by the Wrongs that have been done, which by a known Maxim no man is to do. And fourthly, It will be of dangerous Conſequence, and may give Countenance to the Raviſhment of Children from their Guardians, and Marrying them without any Settlement or Proviſion for them, though never ſo ſolemnly agreed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, And for many other Errors in the Decree appearing, the Appellant humbly prays that the ſame may be Reverſed.</p>
